I"Š<p>Welcome everyone to my blog <strong>Swaad</strong>, and I bring you my first article!
I decided since Salt/Namak is so so important, such an underrated ingredient and yet the hardest to measure, itâ€™s only fair that I start my blog by addressing the biggest elephant in the kitchen.</p>

<p>I really like this observation by <em>Krish Ashok</em> from his book <em>Masala Lab</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Salt is a strange and mysterious substance. This simple molecule brings food to life, and yet it is the only substance we eat that did not originate in a living thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to make things clear, Iâ€™m talking about Table Salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl) right now. Iâ€™ll cover some other commonly used salts too towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-it-important-and-why-should-use-it">Why is it important and why should use it?</h2>
<p>Something is too bitter? Salt it and make it better! 
Making a sweet dish? Just add a pinch of salt, and elevate the flavour.
Making a savoury meal? You know the drill, add salt and it increase the aroma.</p>
