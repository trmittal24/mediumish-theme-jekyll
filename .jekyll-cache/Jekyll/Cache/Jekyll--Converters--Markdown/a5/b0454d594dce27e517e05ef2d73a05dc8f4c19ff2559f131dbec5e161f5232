I"i<p>Welcome everyone to my blog <strong>Swaad</strong>, and I bring you my first article!
I decided since Salt/Namak is so so important, such an underrated ingredient and yet the hardest to measure, it’s only fair that I start my blog by addressing the biggest elephant in the kitchen.</p>

<p>I really like this observation by <em>Krish Ashok</em> in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968807-masala-lab"><em>Masala Lab</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Salt is a strange and mysterious substance. This simple molecule brings food to life, and yet it is the only substance we eat that did not originate in a living thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to make things clear, I’m talking about Table Salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl) right now. I’ll cover some other commonly used salts too towards the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-important-and-why-should-use-it">Why is it important and why should use it?</h3>
<p>Something is too bitter? <em>Salt it and make it better!</em><br />
Making a sweet dish? <em>Just add a pinch of salt, and elevate the flavour.</em><br />
Making a savoury meal? <em>You know the drill, add salt and it increase the aroma!</em><br />
It also helps balance sourness and the overall flavour of the dish.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Tip</strong>: Salt makes vegetables loose water quickly and speeds up the cooking process! Now you know what to do when that damn dish is taking forever to cook ;)</p>

<p>I won’t get into the science of why this happens but do let me know if you want to discuss.</p>

<p>“Okay Tarun, we know salt is important now, but HOW MUCH TO USE IT!?”</p>

<h3 id="measuring-salt">Measuring Salt</h3>
<p>You can salt your dish “Swaad Anusaar” (<em>To Taste</em>) is something we hear just too often and I know everyone new to cooking has a tough time understanding the right quantity. 
See, I will be honest, there is no right amount of salt and people from different regions of the world actually have varying salt tolerances. So, the exact measure will develop only with time. However, I can surely help you get started.</p>

<p>Usually the right quantity of salt lies anywhere between 1-1.5% by weight of the meal. So, for 100gms of curry, approximately 1-1.5gms of Salt. Remember, less salt can always be adjusted by adding more later, but there is no real way to adjust for more salt. So, start with adding salt in steps and keep tasting the dish to understand the development. Please use a spoon to keep a measure, and don’t wing it by sprinkling :p .</p>

</p>

<p>Another tip is <strong>“Season as you go”</strong>, meaning salt each layer of the dish right away. Making a curry with 3 components? Salt the base gravy while cooking it, then salt it again when you add the tomato puree, and finally again when you add the 3rd component (Potato, paneer, veggies…).</p>

<p>Follow these tips and I’m sure you will find your accurate measurement :)</p>

<h3 id="other-salts">Other Salts</h3>

<p>There are some other salts which are worth knowing.</p>

<h4 id="sea-salt">Sea Salt</h4>

<p>
Sea salt has bigger crytals and doesn't contain iodine like table salt. It's generally used as a finishing element while serving the dish providing better contrast and texture owing to it's crytal size and also a burst of flavour.

<p>I really like this salt and it can do wonders when used rightly at the right places, let me explain!
In addition to the saltiness, it has a mild pungent flavour owing to the sulphur present in the compound. Use this in your lemonades, mocktails and similar drinks to give them a new dimension (careful though, add little by little!).
And it goes really well with snacks, especially Indian Chaat. You don’t know, but your favorite roadside vendor probably has this in his chaat masala, do try this at home and thank me later. :)</p>

<p>I hope you learnt something new today and will take these learnings with you to elevate your dishes and find your right salt measure! Keep Cooking folks.</p>

<p><em>Until next time…</em></p>
