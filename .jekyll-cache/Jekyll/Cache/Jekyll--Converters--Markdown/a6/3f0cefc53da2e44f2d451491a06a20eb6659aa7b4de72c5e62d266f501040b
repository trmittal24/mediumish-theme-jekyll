  <p>What is that one thing without which your morning routine isn’t complete? 
What is it which lifts you up when tired and sleepy? 
Well, it even cures cold, cough as well as is tasty for you to always ask more of it. 
It comes in different variants: Ginger, Cardamom, Irani, Black, the list is endless.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need to tell what is it, but in case you are still wondering, it’s <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>Today, in this article, let’s learn how to make a good cup of tea and how you can adjust it to your needs as required. Let’s get started, shall we?</p>

  <li>100ml water</li>
  <li>300ml milk</li>

  <li>1 cardamom</li>
  <li>1 inch ginger</li>

<p>I like a 1:3 water to milk ratio but you can always adjust as per your likings. Ginger and cardamom are usually the most used spices in tea, but cinnamom, cloves and a dash of black pepper powder works well too. If you want to try but are hesitant, you can always use them in small amounts. Experiment and find out what you like. 😋</p>
