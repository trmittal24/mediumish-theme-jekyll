<p>I don‚Äôt think I need to tell you more, but in case you are still wondering:  <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>Today, in this article, let‚Äôs learn how to make a good cup of tea: the process, the common mistakes, and how you can adjust it to your needs as required to own your tea. Let‚Äôs get started, shall we?</p>

<p>I like a 1:3 water to milk ratio but you can always adjust as per your likings. Ginger and cardamom are usually the most used spices in tea, but cinnamon, cloves, and a dash of black pepper powder work well too. If you want to try but are hesitant, you can always use them in small amounts (1/2 inch cinnamon stick, 1 clove, 1 pepper to begin with). Experiment and find out what you like. üòã</p>

<h4 id="brew">Brew</h4>

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Take a vessel of your choice, pour the water in, and turn up the heat. Put in the tea leaves at this stage and let it brew. You can have the flame on medium. Meanwhile, crush the ginger and the cardamom pod well!</p>

</p>
<p>Now add this crushed masala to the water.</p>

<p>This is the most important step of tea making, letting the tea brew patiently in the water. <em>Once you add milk, the tea leaves won‚Äôt have a lot of effect, so please don‚Äôt rush into it. Most of the people I know who struggle at making tea are the ones who are impatient here, don‚Äôt be, the wait will be all worth it.</em> It is okay if your water reduces to even half of what you started with. :P</p>

</p>

<p>After around 5-7 minutes, once the brew is dark and ready, pour in the milk and stir occasionally. You may be tempted to increase the heat, but again, take a deep breath and calm your temptations. Let it come to a boil on its own, and then you can either decrease the flame to the lowest or stir or blow at it, to prevent the tea from spilling. Add 1 tbsp of sugar now. Let the tea get 2-3 boils. Don‚Äôt worry, the successive boils are pretty quick. In total, it‚Äôs around 5-7 minutes more of boiling after you add milk. You can use the attached pics as a reference for an indicator.</p>

</p>

<p>Done, strain, pour yourself and your loved ones some tea, sip on it and enjoy the warm conversations with a satisfying tea.</p>

<h4 id="bonus">Bonus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can pair the masalas according to the weather. Ginger, clove, black pepper are usually good in cold/rainy weather and something like cardamom, cinnamon, fennel are nice in summer. Please start with only a pinch of them if you are not sure of the flavour.</li>
  <li>I recommend a water ratio from 20% to 50% according to what you like.</li>
  <li>Try to use milk that is not pre-boiled. In my experiments, fresh milk has given a much better flavour.</li>
  <li>Always add sugar towards the end because it releases water which slows brewing, but make sure to give at least 1 boil after adding it.</li>
  <li>You can make jaggery tea by substituting it for sugar, but remember to boil more since jaggery takes longer to dissolve.</li>
  <li>Use a vessel at least twice the volume of tea you are making, to avoid regretting spillover later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now what are you waiting for? Get up and make yourself some nice tea. Let me know if you enjoyed it and have any more questions!</p>

<p><em>Until next time‚Ä¶</em></p>
