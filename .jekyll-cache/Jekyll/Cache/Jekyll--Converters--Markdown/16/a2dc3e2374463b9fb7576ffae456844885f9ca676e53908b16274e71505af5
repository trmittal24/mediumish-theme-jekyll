<p>Dips or chutneys as we like to call it, add a new dimension to every dish, playing a supporting role, never overpowering the dish. 
Imagine having your paratha without some fresh coriander mint chuntey, fries without a good tomato dip, idli without the simple coconut chutney or momos with the fiery red hot chutney, Urghhhhh! That’s painful.</p>

<p>So, let’s understand what components make a good chutney, how to build it according to your requirements, convert one variety to multiple. I will also show you a few examples to help you with some headstart.</p>

<p>Let’s begin, <em>shall we</em>?</p>

<h3 id="components-of-chutney">Components of Chutney</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Base         :    Body of dish - coconut, peanut, coriander, tomato</li>
  <li>Thickener    :    Required if the base doesn’t provide good body - Roasted chickpeas, peanuts, cashew, almond</li>
  <li>Freshness    :    Life of dish - green chilli, ginger, lemon, mint, coriander</li>
  <li>Seasoning    :    Balance      - Salt, garlic, pepper, chilli, chaat masala</li>
  <li>Tempering    :    Reinvent     - Oil, Mustard, curry leaves</li>
  <li>Preservative :    Shelf Life   - Vinegar, Oil</li>
</ol>

<p>Above you see some basic components of a chutney that I have listed out, with examples for each component. By no means, is the component list exhaustive, you could find your own substitute/addition.</p>

<p>These two components together define the body and the base flavour making them very important</p>
