<p>If this is what your understanding of dough is, let me help you a little, and if you already can form good shiny balls of dough, stick on, I have some info here for you pro folks as well. :)</p>

<p>I will start with the basics, breaking down a few important concepts, and then summarize it in the end to essentially give you a cheatsheet for your own dough, be it roti, naan, bread, pizza, or anything really. :P</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-dough-basics">Understanding the Dough Basics</h3>

<p>Honestly speaking, a simple dough requires just flour and water in approximately correct ratio. You mix them together to bring everything together in one big ball, and then use it as required. Done, easy, peasy, lemon squeezy? Ummm, yes, but not reallyâ€¦</p>

<p>You see I mentioned <em>correct ratio</em>? Itâ€™s very important to know all the small little things going on behind this simple innocent process to know your ratio. Let me explain it you.</p>

<h4 id="gluten">Gluten</h4>

<p>Donâ€™t worry, gluten is not a bad thing, it is what helps you stretch your Rotis and Bread without breaking down. When you knead the dough, gluten is developed, gluten bonds are formed between the fine flour grains. The more you allow the dough to rest, the more gluten you get, and your bread becomes better. 
Wheat Flour (Indian Roti Flour) generally has lesser gluten than Proccessed Flour/Maida. Hence, for more breads and other soft naan, you see Maida is used due itâ€™s finer grain (implies softness).</p>

<p>You can shorten (or break) the gluten bonds in dough using oil/butter/ghee. Why would one need this you ask? For something like Samosa or Kachori, where you have layers in that fried outer layer, the separation of layers in caused by introducing oils while kneading which helps beautiful separation of layers, and gives you a crispy texture. (Khasta is the hindi word you are looking for)</p>
